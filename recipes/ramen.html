        Ramen is really not as healthy as people like to think. regardless, it's a must-know recipe for
        any fellow weeb. so we're gonna learn how to make some REAL ramen (not just 5 minute noodles with
        a boiled egg on top).
    </strong>
    <h2>Ingredients:</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>Ramen noodles</li>
            <li>Pork loin</li>
            <li>Mushrooms (Japanese variants preferably)</li>
            <li>Meat and vegetable stock</li>
            <li>Your favorite crunchy veggies</li>

        </ul>

                <h3>Make the noodles</h3>
                <p>If you have an asian store nearby, then I'd strongly recommend you get some from there.
                    making authentic japanese noodles is no joke and u'd most likely end up with a mushy mess
                    on your first couple of attempts.
                    but if thats fine with you,here's how to make them.
                     Ingredients:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Baking soda</li>
                        <li>wheat flour</li>
                        <li>Water</li>
                        <li>Yeast</li>
                        <li>Sugar</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>First, you need to make sodiom carbonate. Baking soda is sodium <strong> Bicarbonate</strong>.
                        To avoid turning this into a chemistry article i'll get to the point. we need to cook
                        baking soda in a 200 F oven for about an hour. the result will be sodium carbonate. let's
                        just call it ramen powder for now.
                        Put some yeast and sugar in warm (NOT HOT) water and stir slightly before leaving the mix for
                        15 minutes. this activates the yeast.
                        start mixing flour and water. the ratio should be 1 to 0.4 (100g flour, 40g water).
                        you can also add your ramen powder from earlier with water first.
                        knead and mix until no flour clumps remain and you get a generally dry and crumbled.
                        leave for half an hour.
                        afterwards, press and roll your dough into a sheet. you may cut the dry ugly parts near the edges.
                        now run it through a pasta machine until it's thin and consistant. if you don't
                        own a pasta machine, you may continue to roll and press with a plate till it's as thin as possible.
                        now cut your dough into noodles and voila, your authentic noodles are ready!

                <h3>Cook your pork loin</h3>
                <p>I'm not a pork expert (i've never been able to try pork unfortunately) but cutting it
                    into thin slices and marinating it with spices and olive oil before pan-frying
                    can't go wrong.
                    use the remaining fat to cook your mushrooms. they'll soak up the fat and pork taste.
                </p>

                <h3>Cook your perfect egg</h3>
                <p>
                    a good ramen egg should be jammy/slightly runny on the inside and firm on the outside
                    but if you live somewhere with poor egg quality regulations, i'd just cook it all the way
                    and skip salmonella. otherwise, you can achieve the perfect ramen egg with these simple
                    steps:
                    <ol>
                        <li>poke a tiny hole at the base: this let's the gas escape, resulting in a perfectly
                            shaped egg without the weird circle on top.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            bring the water to a boil: ensures consistant result as the temprature of boiling
                            water is always the same.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            place your egg in the boiling water. if you're adding more than one, keep track
                            of the order in which you add them (I know I know, superficial)
                            the timing sweetspot seems to be exactly 7 minutes. do 6:30 for a more runny and 
                            7:30 for a more jammy yolk.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Place your eggs in ice to instantly stop the cooking process and make them easier
                            to peel.
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Cook your Noodles and veggies</h3>
                <p>
                    ramen noodles cook very quickly. 2 minutes in boiling water should be enough.
                    you may boil your veggies first before cooking the noodles.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Assemble!</h3>
                <p>
                    add your meat stock to your bowl, place your noodles in and everything else on top.
                    decorate with green onion rings and sesame seeds and enjoy!
                </p>
            </li>
        </ol>
