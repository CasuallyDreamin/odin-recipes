        Steak is my personal favorite meal and it's not just about how heavenly it tastes.
        you know the tired, brain-fog state you enter after a meal that forces you into a short nap?
        that's all due to carbs! protein on the other hand, not only doesn't give you that feeling but it also
        keeps you full for a much longer period!
        can't forget the "gains" neither can you?
        not to mention that cooking a steak is extremely straight forward!

    <h2>Ingredients:</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>Beef meat (preferably one rich in marbling)</li>
            <li>Garlic</li>
            <li>Butter</li>
            <li>Salt and black pepper</li>
        </ul>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <h3>Prepare your meat!</h3>
                <p>in order to get the perfect crust and avoid a tasteless steak, your state's surface
                    needs to be dry. this can be achieved by patting your steak dry with a towel and 
                    covering it with salt (coarse kosher or sea salt prefered) and putting it
                    in the refigerator over night!
                    this process is called dry brining which makes your steak more tender and flavorful.

                <h3>Prepare your cooking surface!</h3>
                <p>In my opinion, the best surface to cook your steak is stainless steel for 2 reasons:
                    <ol>
                        <li>it is made to be used at very high temptratures which is exactly what we need!</li>
                        <li>it becomes non-stick at those said tempratures (due to both the leidenfrost effect and the gaps of the surface closing due to expansion.)</li>
                    </ol>
                    you want to place your stainless steel pan on your stove-top and wait for it to heat up.
                    to check if it's ready, splash some water into it. if it begins to boil and evaporate, then it's not ready.'
                    if it forms a ball and starts dancing around the pan, the time has come!
                </p>
            </li>

                <h3>Searing the steak</h3>
                <p>I've found that using black better before placing your steak in the pan for the first time tends to burn your precious black pepper.
                    so we simply apply some salt to both sides and place it on the pan <strong>AWAY FROM YOU.</strong> this is 
                    important because 1. it makes it easier for your steak to not stick to the pan and 2. it's safer for your hands.
                    gently wiggle the steak to ensure it not sticking. then wait for a minute and flip it. if it's not seared enough yet, flip it back to the same side.
                    once the sear has formed, turn down the heat to middle and cover each side with black pepper before searing them a bit more.
                    <strong>Make sure to not finish your sear all the way as this would result in an overcooked surface after the next step.</strong>
                </p>
            </li>

                <h3>Baste like your life depends on it!</h3>
                <p>at this point is where you want to add your butter and garlic! make sure to smash your garlic!
                    as soon as the butter melts, begin pouring the melted buffer over your steak non-stop! this ensures a moist, tender
                    and flavorful steak while keeping your sear intact! you could also add any herbs u'd like at this stage.
                    think oregano, thyme, rosemary or whatever else floats your boat.
                    baste for a good 5-7 minutes. you want to flip your steak every 30 seconds to avoid overcooking! 
                </p>

                <h3>>Let it rest</li>h3>
                <p>this step is extremely important as if u don't, u'll just end up with a dry tasteless steak.
                    letting your steak stops the juice to burst out of your steak the instant you cut it. it also allows you to
                    practice impulse control and have a nice little chat with yourself about your life choices. 10/10.
                </p>
